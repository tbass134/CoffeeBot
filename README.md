Ever wanted to know if you should have hot coffee or iced?, let a machine answer that for you!

The following project is a Machine Learning application that is able to predict if you(a coffee drinking user) should have iced coffee or hot coffee using daily weather data

Over the past year, I have kept track of my coffee habits on a daily basis. 
There is a IOS app (link soon) and a Alexa skill (link soon) to help me track my habits.

My coffee habits are all stored on Firebase.

How:
On the IOS app and the alexa skill, i use OpenWeatheMap(https://openweathermap.org) to get the current weather conditions and what type of coffee i drink

For more detail on the training data, please see CoffeeBot.ipyb
